# CTP-Full

The project was built and should be run using Visual Studio 2015. 
The project can be opened using the Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file ‘CTP-project-ES’, found in the root folder. 
As Github does not correctly store build configurations, 
the project should be set to an x86 solution platform as opposed to the default x64 before running. 
This is required to make use of the third party library that handles sprites, SFML.
